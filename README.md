## 💡 MY ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY

> *"Good design is invisible. Great design is felt through performance, reliability, and efficiency."*

I believe that successful mechanical engineers don't just analyze components—they understand the **entire ecosystem**: how parts are made, how they fail, how they interact, and how they impact the bigger system. Whether it's a CubeSat bracket surviving launch vibrations, a CFRP pump shaft resisting corrosion, or a microchannel cooling a high-heat-flux chip, every detail matters.

- **Elements**: Tetrahedral/Solid with refined meshing at stress concentration zones
- **Mesh refinement**: 0.025" at hole edges, 0.04" at fillets

## 🧠 ENGINEERING INSIGHTS & LEARNING

### What This Project Taught Me:

1. **Mesh Refinement is Critical**  
   Using 0.025" element size at stress concentration zones was essential for accurate Kt prediction. Coarser meshes underestimated peak stresses by >10%.

2. **Multi-axial Stress States Matter**  
   The plate with hole showed transverse stresses (2,454 psi) due to Poisson effects—something 2D analysis would miss entirely.

3. **Geometric Effects Dominate Material Choices**  
   Increasing beam moment of inertia by 575% reduced stress by 75.6%—a far greater impact than switching to a higher-strength material.

4. **Principal Stress vs Equivalent Stress**  
   For shoulder fillets, maximum principal stress gave better correlation with Peterson's Kt (+2.2%) compared to von-Mises stress (-5.5%).

5. **Theory Validated**  
   Peterson's formulas were validated within ±6.5% across all cases, with best correlation at 2.2% for optimal mesh.

### How This Applies to My Interests:

| Interest Area | Application from This Project |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| **Design & Manufacturing** | Understanding stress concentrations helps design parts that won't fail at holes, fillets, and corners |
| **R&D** | Validating FEA against theory builds confidence in simulation-driven design |
| **Robotics** | Lightweight beam design principles apply directly to robot arm structures |
| **Supply Chain** | Design choices (like adding fillets) affect manufacturability and cost |

# 🛰️ PROJECT 2: CubeSat Electronics Mounting Bracket

> **Aerospace-grade structural analysis for spaceflight hardware**

## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### 🎯 Objective
Design and validate a lightweight mounting bracket to secure an electronics box within a CubeSat satellite frame during launch. The bracket must:
- Withstand **10g acceleration loads** in X, Y, and Z axes
- Maintain **natural frequencies above 65 Hz** to avoid resonance with launch vehicles
- Achieve **minimum safety factor > 1.5**
- Minimize mass while ensuring structural integrity

### 🚀 Why This Matters
CubeSats are exposed to extreme vibration during rocket launch. A failed bracket means lost electronics, failed mission, and wasted millions. This project demonstrates real-world aerospace engineering where **safety is non-negotiable**.

## 🧠 ENGINEERING INSIGHTS & LEARNING

### What This Project Taught Me:

1. **Nonlinear Contact Modeling is Critical**  
   Frictional contact (µ=0.2) between surfaces significantly affects load transfer. Ignoring it would overestimate stiffness by >30%.

2. **Mesh Refinement Strategy Matters**  
   Using 2.0mm element size at brackets with 3.0mm global sizing captured stress gradients accurately while maintaining computational efficiency.

3. **Geometric Optimization > Material Upgrade**  
   Iteration 2 achieved **72% stress reduction** through geometry improvements, not just material change—proving design matters more than material selection.

4. **Modal Analysis Prevents Resonance**  
   Both iterations exceeded 65Hz requirement, with Iteration 2 achieving **281 Hz**—4.3× the minimum requirement, ensuring safe operation.

5. **Validation Builds Confidence**  
   Force reaction checks (<23.5% error) and mesh convergence studies validated that simulation results are trustworthy.

## 🧠 ENGINEERING INSIGHTS & LEARNING

### What This Project Taught Me:

1. **Composite Design is Iterative**  
   The initial [0/90] layup failed under shear loads. Adding ±45° plies reduced IRF from >1 to 0.04—a critical lesson in anisotropic material behavior.

2. **Ply Trimming Balances Weight & Strength**  
   Dropping two 90° plies reduced weight while maintaining SM >10—showing that strategic material removal can optimize performance.

3. **Tsai-Wu Criterion is Essential**  
   For orthotropic materials, simple von-Mises stress isn't enough. Tsai-Wu failure criterion properly accounts for fiber-direction vs transverse strengths.

4. **Thermal Effects Matter in Composites**  
   With CTE = -5e-7 in fiber direction but 3e-5 transverse, thermal loads create significant internal stresses that must be analyzed.

5. **Margin of Safety vs Deformation Trade-off**  
   The improved layup achieved SM = 12.287 but increased deformation—real engineering requires balancing competing requirements.

### How This Applies to My Career Interests:

| Interest Area | Application from This Project |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| **Pump Design** | Direct industry experience—worked as pump designer before MS |
| **Composite Materials** | Advanced material selection for corrosive environments |
| **R&D** | Iterative optimization from concept to validated design |
| **Manufacturing** | Ply trimming impacts manufacturability and cost |
| **Supply Chain** | Material selection (CFRP vs steel) affects sourcing and lifecycle cost |
